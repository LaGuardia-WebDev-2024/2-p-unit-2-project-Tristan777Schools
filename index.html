<h3>Week 1</h3>

<p>In July 2024, YPC went on a plane to travel to New Zealand for the World Choir Games, with the intent to win all competitions.
</p>
<p>Our first competition was the in the Pop category. We performed River Deep Mountain High/Proud Mary, Power Of Love/Do You Love Me You Will Be Found, and Can't Buy Me Love. We ended up winning 1st place and World Championship with </p>

<p>On the same day, just a few hours later, we performed our Youth set. We sang Iuppiter, Naturaleza, The Sun Never Says, and Ranpono. We didn't win first place but we won gold, scoring</p>

<p>Not too long in the same week, it was time for the Children's set. The songs performed were Picaflor, Perception, TJAK, and My Soul's Been Anchored.</p>

<h3>Week 2</h3>

<p>After our first weeks hardworking performances, we deserved some rest, relaxation and fun. By the time Week 2 rolled around, we had to soon get started on our next set. </p>

<p>Gospel is up next. We went to a relatively small but echoey hall. We performed the songs What An Awesome God, For Every Mountain, and Joyful, Joyful.</p>

<p>Finally we had our Spiritual set. Since it was our last one, it wasn't time for gamesâ€”not that it ever was in the first place! The songs we performed were Ezekiel Saw the Wheel, Didn't My Lord Deliver Daniel, Sit Down Servant, and Motherless Child.</p>
